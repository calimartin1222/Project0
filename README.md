# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This website is a quick introduction to me and my interests and meets the project0 requirements.

The html files contain links to the other html pages utilizing
a Boostrap component (the buttons) and various other elements required.

The css files contain styles for different elements, ids and classes,
along with mobile responsive attributes of objects throughout the html files.

The scss file is a blueprint for the css file of the same name. I used Sass
to convert the original scss file that allowed me to do more logic than with normal css.
